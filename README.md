# instancer

`Instancer` is a simple API to provision and deploy containerized web-based CTF challenges on a per-team basis.

`Instancer` requires authentication to both launch instances and create challenges for deployments. In [routes/auth.js](routes/auth.js), this is implemented according to the [ctfjs](https://github.com/blairsec/ctfjs) `/self` route, but it can be modified as necessary, as long as the contest route returns the user and team id, and whether the user should have administrative privileges or not.

Token-bucket ratelimiting is also supported using a Redis store, with configurable settings through environment variables.

Additionally, `instancer` automatically terminates launched instances that live past a configurable amount of time, saving resources when unused.

## Background

Certain capture-the-flag challenges require getting privilege escalation. For native applications, solutions such as [redpwn/jail](https://github.com/redpwn/jail/) exist to provide secure and isolated sandboxes for competitors. However, it is not usable for web challenges.

`Instancer` fills this gap, and allows teams to provision web challenges individually.

For example, I wrote a challenge named [filestore](https://hackmd.io/@Solderet/AngstromCTF2023#Filestore---Web) for Ã¥ngstromCTF 2023. As it was intended to require a bit of bruteforce as well as remote privilege escalation, it would have benefited greatly from running as an instanced challenge.

## Environment variables

The following environment variables are required:

| Name              | Description                                                                      | Required? |

## Deployment

`Instancer` is meant to be deployed on GCP as a Cloud Run instance.

First, build and push the instance to Artifact Registry. Then, create an IAM role with Cluster Admin permissions. Finally, run `instancer` with the appropriate IAM role.

Additionally, if you want to deploy a Redis instance on the same cloud, you can use [this guide](https://cloud.google.com/memorystore/docs/redis/connect-redis-instance-cloud-run) to set it up.

## Models

### Challenge

A Challenge object contains information about the deployment details of a CTF challenge.

## Routes

There are three main services:

-   [auth](#auth)
-   [challenges](#challenges)
-   [instances](#instances)

A single lock (ðŸ”’) means that user-level authentication is required to access the route.
A double lock (ðŸ”’ðŸ”’) means that admin-level authentication is required to access the route.
